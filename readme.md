"I like the scientific spirit -- the holding off, the being sure but not too sure, the willingness to surrender ideas when the evidence is against them . . . it always keeps the way beyond open -- always gives life, thought, affection" - Walt Whitman

"It would thus be our task to adapt our language and thought, and hence also our scientific philosophy, to this new situation engendered by the experiments. But that, unfortunately, is very difficult." - Werner Heisenberg

"Technically, chemistry is the study of matter. But I prefer to see it as the study of change." - Walter White

"And I asked myself about the present: how wide it was, how deep it was, how much was mine to keep." - Kurt Vonnegut in _Slaughterhouse-Five_

"The years go by, and I've told the story so many times that I'm not sure anymore whether I actually remember it or whether I just remember the words I tell it with." - Jorge Luis Borges

"The best teacher is experience and not through someone's distorted point of view." "There was nothing to talk about anymore. The only thing to do was go." - Jack Kerouac
